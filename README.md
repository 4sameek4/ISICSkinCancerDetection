# ISICSkinCancerDetection
In this project, we have implemented various deep learning models over the cancer images of nature benign and malignant to come up with a model suitable for prediction of the skin cancer at an early stage. We have used various feature engineering techniques and also evaluated the models using relevant metrics based on the combination of each feature engineering technique.
